## Difficult to find Software

Murphy-Hill 2015 - abstract:
"It is difficult for users to be aware of all the tools that might be useful to them"
=> Tools im Sinne von Funktionen innerhalb einer Software

Hucka & Graham 2018 - 2:
"yet finding software suitable for a given purpose remains surprisingly difficult"

## Folgen schwieriger Softwaresuche

Hucka & Graham 2018 - 2:
"lack of better resources brings the potential for duplication of work, reduced scientific reproducibility, and poor return on investment by funding agencies"

## information behavior for seeking software underresearched

Murphy-Hill 2015 - abstract:
"we know little about social solutions, such as one user telling a peer about a tool"
Social Solutions? => social learning == information behavior

Fry 2006
"the way in which scholarly communities coordinate and control research problems, techniques, strategies, task outcomes and reputations will significantly influence the production and use of digital infrastructures and resources across fields."

Lenoir 1997
"the discipline primarily plays a pedagogical and administrative role, while the intellectual field represents the 'research front'

Roos 2015
"The domain-analytic approach argues that domain or discipline is important in
understanding the information practices of researchers."

Hjorland & Albrechtsen 1995
"knowledge-domains as thought or discourse communities, which are parts of society’s division of labor. Knowledge organization, structure, cooperation patterns, language and communication forms, information systems, and relevance criteria are reflections of the objects of the work of these communities and of their role in society"

Palmer & Cragin 2009
"Understanding the nature of information practices and their relation to the production of scholarship is important for both theoretical and applied work in library and information science (LIS)."

## Institutional Support for Humanities in Using Digital Tools
Given & Wilson 2018
"The affordances of digital tools have created new methodologies, not only requiring new
training and institutional support"
