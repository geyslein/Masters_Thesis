Murphy-Hill 2015 - abstract:
"It is difficult for users to be aware of all the tools that might be useful to them"
=> Tools im Sinne von Funktionen innerhalb einer Software

Hucka & Graham 2018 - 2:

Hucka & Graham 2018 - 2:

Murphy-Hill 2015 - abstract:
"we know little about social solutions, such as one user telling a peer about a tool"
Social Solutions? => social learning == information behavior
