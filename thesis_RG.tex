\chapter{Introduction}
Today, software is a central component of science. Throughout the entire research life cycle, researchers use software tools for data collection, transformation, analysis and presentation as well as for generating hypotheses, managing literature and writing scientific papers \citep{Kethers2017, Pan2016, Wolski2017}. Software has changed the way we actually do science. The complexity of the analyses carried out by researchers has increased, as has the amount of data that researchers can process. Software supports the documentation of the research process and enables reproducibility \citep{DallmeierTiessen2016, Waltemath2016} and accuracy of results.

Due to the increased importance of research software for research \citep{Katz2017} and the increase in the sheer number of software, it is all the more important for researchers to identify suitable software and select the one which best fits the research problem, the actual step in the research process, or the research data which has to be processed, and, in consequence, which satisfies the researchers information need \citep{Wilson1994}. In addition to increased efforts, difficulties in seeking software can also endanger the scientific reproducibility of studies or even lead to multiple developments of software with identical functions instead of reusing existing software \citep{Hucka2018}.

Information seeking of researchers is generally of great interest within the field of information, be it information behavior \citep[e.g.]{Ahmadianyazdi2018, Barrett2005, Campbell2017, Catalano2013, Ellis1993, Hemminger2007, Korobili2011,  Liyana2017, Rimmer2006, RuppSerrano2013, Wang2008} or information practices \citep[e.g.]{Boyum2015, Bulger2011, Fry2006, Given2018, Roos2015}. However, seeking software is still rather challenging for researchers \citep{Howison2015}. In a recent study, \citet{Hucka2018} surveyed scientists and engineers from several fields to better understand their approaches and selection criteria for seeking software. They found out that "\textit{finding software suitable for a given purpose remains surprisingly difficult}". Even in the domain of software development, the main challenge for software reuse are difficulties in finding software artifacts as \citet{Bauer2014} revealed in a study on code reuse at Google. \citet{Grossman2009} identified users unawareness of specific software tools. These results are all the more surprising because the participants in the cited studies come from a group with a greater affinity for software (software developers, engineers).

The lack of awareness of specific software tools among researchers has been addressed by several technical solutions. Code aggregators, specialized search engines, programming language package repositories, code and application repositories, research repositories (e.g. Zenodo or Figshare), and curated web lists and catalogues aid users in discovering software \citep{Struck2018}. Standards and tools for citing software enable researchers to identify, cite and reuse software \citep[e.g.]{Niemeyer2016, Smith2016, Soito2017}. Research funding agencies and research organizations \citep[e.g.]{Haupt2018, Katerbow2018, Scheliga2019} adopt guidelines for the development and use of research software with the aim of increasing the reusability and quality of the software artifacts developed. In turn, the technical solutions presented are also aimed more at a technically experienced audience, often even at software developers directly. For researchers with less experience in the use of software, e.g. from the humanities \citep{Rimmer2006}, seeking software remains a difficult undertaking.

The information-seeking behavior of humanities scholars in general has been addressed widely \citep[e.g.]{Barrett2005, Bronstein2007, Bronstein2007a, Catalano2013, Ellis1993, Given2018, Korobili2011, Liew2006, Rimmer2006}. In his pioneering work on Grounded Theory in information-seeking, \citet{Ellis1993} identified patterns of information-seeking of social sciences, sciences, and humanities scholars. In 2005, \citet{Barrett2005} analyzed information-seeking habits of graduate student researchers in the humanities. Korobili{2011} examined factors influencing information-seeking behavior at the philosophy faculties. While studies in information behavior draw on the cognitive viewpoint, information practice studies are guided by the ideas of social constructionism and collectivism \citep{Savolainen2007, Talja2005, Talja2007}. Humanities scholars information-seeking practices have also been addressed in several studies \citep{Benardou2013, Bulger2011, Given2018, Palmer2009}. In previous studies, however, the classic research process of humanities scholars has been examined, which is mainly based on literature research. Although the information-seeking in the humanities is also based on software tools, e.g. databases, web-based editions, search engines, or online journals \citep{Barrett2005, Rimmer2006}, the search for software itself is rarely discussed. One of these rare examples, however a non-humanities one, is Hepworths et al. \citeyearpar{Hepworth2017} study of journalism professors' information-seeking behavior. While seeking new online tools, journalism professors rely on other journalism professors, followed closely by media-related foundations, media professionals, and conferences.

- Introduction:

The social constructionist paradigm puts emphasis on social practices, ``the concrete and situated activities of interacting people, reproduced in routine social contexts across time and space’’ (Rosenbaum, 1993, p. 239). A focus on
practices rather than on behaviour shifts the analysis from cognitive to social and is consistent with the study of information seekers within their social context (for examples, see Rothbauer (2002), McKenzie and Davies (2002)).

\chapter{Research Design}
Since "\textit{[u]nderstanding the nature of information practices and their relation to the production of scholarship is important for both theoretical and applied work in library and information science (LIS)}" \citep[p. 165]{Palmer2009} this thesis sets out to study information practices of humanities scholars and their seeking for research software to better understand humanists needs and future LIS services \citep{Case2008, Cunningham2010}. With information practices we mean practices of seeking, managing, giving, and using information in context \citep{Palmer2009}. I chose an exploratory study design \citep{Rinsdorf2013} where the personal realm of experience of each interviewee lies in the center of the analysis. Through an explorative approach to the object of research, qualitative social research approaches the social and subjective reality constructed by humans. Theory development is usually inductive, using the individual cases of empirical studies. Acting in a sociocultural context is always an interpretative process. In this respect, \citet[p. 20ff]{Lamnek2005} distinguishes six principles that qualitative research should be guided by: openness, communication, process-like, reflexivity, explication, and flexibility.

The aim of this work is to investigate the information-seeking practices of early-career philologists when seeking research software (RQ1). This research focuses on philologists problems, contradictions and barriers in finding information and their information sharing about research software. Special emphasis will be placed on the respondents' recourse to their own research process and the knowledge and practice structures in their field \citep{Hjorland1995} which are socially constructed (RQ2):

\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}p{12cm}}
& \\
\textbf{RQ1}: & What information seeking practices humanities scholars engage in when looking for software to use with research data? \\ 
\textbf{RQ2}: & How do domain specific structures shape the information practices of humanists? \\ 
& \\
\end{tabular}\\  

With this thesis I want to comply with the principles of an open science\footnote{\url{https://ocsdnet.org/manifesto/open-science-manifesto/}}. Hence, I have decided that all data generated during the concept, survey, analysis, and writing phase is publicly available on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/geyslein/Masters_Thesis}}, as long as it meets research ethics standards of the \citet{DeutscheForschungsgemeinschaft2019}: Interview audio records and unanonymized interview transcripts are excluded. Prior to the study, I obtained the consent of the interviewees regarding the interview recording and later regarding the transcribed interviews.

\section{Methods of Data Collection and Processing}
\label{sec:data_collection}
%% Einleitung
According to \citet[p. 329]{Lamnek2005}, the qualitative paradigm sees the interview as the ideal way to collect data. Compared to the participating observation, it is much easier to realize. Moreover, qualitative research on the interpretation of texts is very advanced. The qualitative interview can be recorded, intersubjectively traced, and arbitraryly reproduced. Consequently, the findings of the study are derived from accounts of information practices and not from observation of information practices as it happened. 

%%Sampling
The first step in data collection was to establish contact with the potential interview partners. It was necessary to consider criteria based on preliminary considerations derived from theory. The goal of this work is to investigate information practices of humanities scholars in the search for software. I assumed that software is now an integral part of scientific work in the humanities as well, so I did not make any further preliminary considerations in this regard. Since there is a very large spectrum of subjects within the humanities, I had to minimize the resulting side effects during the investigation. Practical criteria of field access helped with the selection, according to which I chose the area of classical philology. With this convenience sampling strategy, I gained access to two participants with little effort. The two participants then provided referrals for new participants. Through the snowball sampling strategy \citep{Biernacki1981}, I was able to achieve a desired sample size of 5 test persons relatively quickly. None of the contacted persons refused the participation in the study.

%% Interviews
Interviews are the main data gathering technique which are guided by semi-structured interview guidelines, and implemented in a face-to-face manner \citep{Bryman2004} in German language. With the interviews I obtain emotions, thoughts, and intentions of the participants and discover their perspective of the social world \citep{Patton2002}. Due to the corona pandemic situation, I originally planned the interviews as a virtual setup with the help of web conferencing software. Since a reduced attention span and lack of experience with web conferencing was assumed among the interviewees, I planned two interviews per participant. The first two interviewees already accepted this setting. In the meantime, however, the first relaxation measures took effect, which is why we agreed on face-to-face interviews. Such a setup with two staggered interviews (planned minimum interval of 2 weeks) increases flexibility, as it allows for adjustments in the second interview after the analysis of the first interview. In addition, I was able to refer to contents of the first interview. Furthermore, it enabled reflection and self-observation processes among the interviewees regarding the search and use of software. I conducted 9 interviews. Four interviewees were interviewed twice. The interview duration varied between 60 and 90 minutes. Due to practical reasons, the fifth interviewee agreed to conduct a longer interview (duration 125 minutes) instead of the two-interview-setup.

The interviewees agreed to the interviews, their recording and the publication of the anonymized protocols by signing a declaration of consent at the beginning of the first interview\footnote{see \url{https://github.com/geyslein/Masters_Thesis/blob/master/_data/collection/consent\%20form\%20interview\%20(German).md} for the consent form}. In the beginning of the interviews, I briefly introduced myself and the background of the study. All interviews were conducted in the offices of the interviewees or in meeting rooms of the institute. During the interviews I followed the structure of the interview guidelines.

% Interviewleitfaden
The interview guidelines support the thematic structuring of the interview, but should nevertheless leave enough free space for the qualitative process during the interview as well as for the ideas of the interview partners. At the beginning of the interview guidelines, there are questions about studies, doctorate, previous work experience and the current position. It is followed by questions about the contents, the methods used and the theories of the own research. Afterwards, the field of investigation is approached by discussing the search process in general, using the example of one's own literature research. And on the other hand, the not very familiar topic of software will be opened up by means of easy introductory questions (Section A).  Section B focuses on the sources that are used in the search for software. The largest of the sections, Section C, focuses on information practices in the search for and use of software. Based on the literature on information practices, the section is divided into Seeking, Scanning, Monitoring, Proxy, Context and Avoiding. In Section D, the last part of the interview guide, follow-up questions for the second interview are provided, which are chosen depending on the respondent and the course of the first interview. The complete interview guide is listed in the appendix (\ref{sec:Interview_guide}).

% Aufnahme
To ensure the reproducibility of the interviews, they were recorded with a standard voice recorder and, in parallel, with a voice recording app for an android smartphone. The interviews were recorded without disturbances as far as possible and could be transcribed completely due to good recording quality. The recording of an interview actually contradicts the demand for a natural communication situation and possibly causes rejection on the part of the interviewees. Guaranteeing anonymity and informing the interviewees about the necessity of recording should prevent this. By using tape or digital recording devices, it is also possible to conduct the interview situation inconspicuously and in its natural environment.

%% Transcription
For a later analysis of the conversation content a transcription is necessary. Transcription means the writing of audiovisual material, in this case the audio recordings of the interviews. The transcript as a result of this process thus already embodies a first subjective selection and reduction of the interview recording \citep[p. 321]{Edwards2003}. Once the interviews were conducted, I orthografically transcribed the interviews recordings using EasyTranscript, an open source transcription software\footnote{\url{https://www.e-werkzeug.eu/index.php/de/produkte/easytranscript}}. The transcription system used for this purpose should be based on the specific research objective \citep[p. 331]{Edwards2003}. The aim of this work is an evaluation of the discussions in terms of content and topic. A sophisticated transcription system, which is required for a conversation-analytical examination, was therefore not necessary. I chose a verbatim and partially annotated transcription system, which considers several para- and non-verbal aspects. The following conventions were applied:

\small
\begin{table}
\caption{Transcription conventions}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 & \\
\hline
\hline
 	(lachen) & Laughter\\
 	ähm	& Non-lexical utterance (uh, erm, um)\\
 	{[Anony]} & Anonymized parts of the transcript\\
	(DESCRIPTIONS)	& Further Explanations if text was anonymized\\
	               & or not considered (off-topic)\\
\hline
 & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\normalsize

I did not check the finished transcripts for correct spelling after the transcription for reasons of time economy. Further, I translated the relevant text passages for the final thesis into English anyway, whereby attention was paid to the correct use of spelling and grammar.

%% Anonymisierung UND Cross-Check probanden
In the next step, the interview transcripts were anonymized from information regarding person, institutes, university, thesis and research topics, and criticism expressed during the interview. This was done at the request of all interview participants. They attached great importance to this step already before we conducted the interviews. Further, they intensively controlled the transcripts after the anonymization. On request, I then anonymized further aspects in the interviews.

%% Statistik Transkripte
The process finally results 12 hours and 22 minutes of audio recordings and 162 pages of interview transcripts (Arial, 12pt). 

\section{Process of Data Analysis}
After I received consent from all participants for the anonymized research transcripts, I analyzed the transcripts with a qualitative content analysis to explore qualified hypotheses \citep{Kohlbacher2006, Krippendorff2012, Mayring2000, Mayring2014}. It enables the researcher to include textual information and to identify its properties systematically. In detail, I chose a qualitative content analysis according to \citet{Mayring2014}. For the analysis process I used an open source software called QualCoder\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder}}, which supports coding, annotation and category building. 

% open coding
In a first step, I approached the material using systematic open coding \citep{Corbin1990} to conceptualize and categorize the interview data. For this purpose, I have deductively identified categories from the knowledge about information practices, the field, and the process of compiling the interview guide. During the analysis, I inductively derived codes and categories and constantly revised the existing ones. The previously established category system is thus constantly modified and further developed, taking into account the demand for openness and flexibility of the research process. 

% inhaltsanalyse - eventuell noch category system näher beschreiben
\citet[p. 65]{Mayring2014} describes three basic interpretation techniques: reduction, explication and structuring. With the analysis I aim to \textit{reduce} the material to the core statements. For the interpretation of the present interview data I have chosen the \textit{inductive category formation} as a form of data reduction. In contrast to summarizing, the other and very extensive reduction method, inductive category formation considers only those parts relevant for the research question and the step of paraphrasing is skipped \cite[p. 79]{Mayring2014}. The final category system can be looked up in the Appendix (\ref{sec:Category_system}).

% während transkription, analyse und selbst während schreibprozess - consulting of participants
During transcription, coding, analysis and even during the writing process, I was able to contact Interviewees for field-specific questions. The private contacts with two Interviewees and the lunch, which I promised in return for the study participation and which  took place a few weeks after the interviews, were especially helpful. During these consultations, the interviewees answered my field-specific questions, such as correct descriptions and background information on the databases used or misunderstandings of certain workflows. I was also able to confront them with the findings and hypotheses I had developed and to obtain a qualified opinion and possibly a correction of the same.

\chapter{Findings}
The findings of the study are structured as follows. First, I will give a short overview of the field of classical philology under investigation (section \ref{sec:introduction_field}). Afterwards I will briefly present the situation of software use in the research process of the participants (section \ref{SW_use}). The main part of the results will be the information practices in search for and use of software (section \ref{sec:IP_SW}), as well as field- or domain-specific factors regarding problems, barriers and contradictions in the search for software (section \ref{sec:Domain_Factors}).

\section{Introduction of the Empirical Field}
\label{sec:introduction_field}
% the institute, small, family like, history
Classical Philology is one of the oldest subjects at our interviewee's university. It first flourished in the sixteenth century. In the nineteenth century, the institute became a center of classical philology. The dominant field of work at that time was edition philology. In the twentieth century, scholars opened up the great texts of antiquity in commentaries and interpretations. Similar to classical philology, the institute has declined in importance since its zenith in the 19th century and today counts about 20 scholars. Both Latin and Greek studies can be studied at the institute.
% interviewees
In the present study I interviewed 5 members of the institute who are engaged as research assistants, PhD students or in post-doc positions at the institute. A brief profile of each interviewee is depicted in table \ref{tab:interviewees}.

% field kP
%% Eigenschaften
During the interviews the participants attributed various characteristics to the field of classical philology or the way classical philologists think and work which participants perceived as typical. %conservative 
In Sandra's opinion, classical philologist "\textit{[...] are quite conservative in their approach. They work the way they have always worked.} [Sandra, 1st interview\footnote{In the following, I use the convention [NAME, No. of Interview], for example [Sandra, 1] for the first and [Sandra, 2] for the second interview}]. This attribute was unanimously confirmed by the statements of the other interviewees. This means that they maintain a very analog way of working, use few digital tools and work mainly with the printed book. %critical 
Furthermore, research is marked by an extremely critical and exact engagement with the available primary sources which is "\textit{a very central question}" [Peter, 1] for the whole field of classical philology. The sub domain edition science in which textual criticism takes place is "\textit{[...] actually the royal discipline [...] You just have to be extremely strict with yourself.}" [Sandra, 1]. In addition, a very friendly, helpful and open athmosphere is maintained among colleagues. This was mentioned in all interviews and also the way how easy the already mentioned snowball sampling (section \ref{sec:data_collection}) was supports this impression.

%% Teilbereiche
In addition to edition studies, there are also other sub domains of classical philology. In the interviews, for example, literary studies, philosophy, palaeography, papyrology, history, and translatology were mentioned as sub domains in which the participants are active or at least used to be active. Meanwhile there are also several professorships for Digital Humanities at the university, which will complement and continue the existing cooperation with the department of computer science and above all act as mediators between the humanities and the computer sciences. 

\section{Software Use}
\label{SW_use}
To get a first overview of the software used by the classical philologists examined, I will briefly introduce the tools mentioned by the participants in the following section.
% wenig
The conservative working style mentioned in the previous section based on few digital tools becomes visible in the number and scope of the tools used and mentioned during the interviews. The most frequently used tool is the text editor \gls{Word} from Microsoft, which the interviewees use for writing research papers and for managing their literature references:

\begin{quotation}
"\textit{Well, I actually work quite analog I must say. I have a Word document and there I have my literature list, which I partly keyword to find things using the search function. [...] But this is basically a very analog way of working.}" [Marco, 1]
\end{quotation}

Marco confirms that philologists work very analogously, i.e. with few software tools. Although there are many software tools dedicated to literature management, all interviewees stated that they also use Word for literature management. And all of them also mentioned that they heard about the \gls{Citavi}\footnote{https://www.citavi.com/en} reference management software and recognized its usefulness for that very purpose. Christian explained it as follows:

\begin{quotation}
"\textit{I know that Citavi exists. But I was so used to work with Word from the beginning that I always manage my literature this way. I wanted to get used to Citavi, but it scared me a bit, because I had heard that it takes a long time to get used to it, so I thought, okay, now you do it as always.}" [Christian, 1]
\end{quotation}
 
For most of the interviewees the learning curve to switch to Citavi was too big, they had progressed too far in their dissertation so that a change was no longer worthwhile or they had already learned in their bachelor or master studies to use Word and did not feel the urgent need to change it later. 
% typegreek
Two interviewees explicitly mentioned a small tool, typegreek\footnote{http://www.typegreek.com/}, that facilitates the writing of ancient Greek text with politonic, unicode-compliant characters. Marco was apparently the first to discover this tool and then recommended it to his colleague Peter who mentioned that "\textit{If I had known this in my studies, many seminar papers would have been less painful.}" [Peter, 1].

% sw um die literaturquellen herum, zur präsentation + zusatzfunktionen
However, the largest collection of tools used was mentioned in terms of searching and accessing literature. Interviewees often use databases or digital libraries that contain primary sources of classical philology. 
%% literaturdatenbanken als software
For the Greek language, the most prominent database is the \gls{TLG}\footnote{https://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu}, which is a collection of all texts written in Greek from antiquity to the present era. A similar database exists also for the Latin language, the \gls{TLL}\footnote{https://db.degruyter.com/databasecontent?dbid=tll\&dbsource=\%2Fdb\%2Ftll\&language=en}.  Interviewees regard both tools as standard tools that are basically without alternative in the digital world. Sandra comments for the \gls{TLG}: 

\begin{quotation}
"\textit{You can't build a more complete TLG now than the one that is there. This is not possible per se and nothing will change substantially. [...] TLG they really have a kind of monopoly on the data, on the texts.}" [Sandra, 2]
\end{quotation}

%% bibliographic databases
The same applies to the bibliographic databases. Here, the \gls{APh}\footnote{http://www.brepols.net/Pages/BrowseBySeries.aspx?TreeSeries=APH-O} is generally considered the standard index for scholarly work on Ancient Greece or Rome: "\textit{the l'Année philologique, that is the be-all and end-all.}" [Marie, 1]. At the beginning of their research process, the Interviewees would always seek in the APh for research on a particular topic. 
%% rezensions'organe' 
In addition to bibliographic databases, review journals play an important role for the interviewees in their search for current research work and publications. The international journal \gls{BMCR}\footnote{http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/} as well as the German journal \gls{Gnomon}\footnote{https://www.chbeck.de/buecher/zeitschriften/gnomon/} were frequently mentioned by the Interviewees. Sandra on the distribution and advantages of BMCR over other review journals: 

\begin{quotation}
"\textit{What actually almost all classical philologists have subscribed to as newsletter is the so-called BMCR, that is Bryn Mawr Classical Review. That is a review journal. The only difference, it's not better than all the others, but it just appears online. And they send it to you right away. Whenever someone finishes it, they send it to you, and that way it gets read a lot more than anything else. They just noticed very quickly in which direction digitization is going to. I assume that many more people will read it. Because it's just totally convenient, I get it via email.}" [Sandra, 1]
\end{quotation}

In particular, she highlights the immediate online availability and email notification as advantages over other services, which is why BMCR has quickly become the standard among philologists. %% suchmaschinen google
Some interviewees also use \gls{Google}\footnote{https://scholar.google.com} for literature research. 
%% neuere ansätze: 
A more recent phenomenon among the participants is the use of \gls{Academia}\footnote{https://www.academia.edu}, a social networking website for academics where they can share ideas, research interests, and publications. Marco thinks it is "\textit{[...] sometimes very handy when people have just uploaded stuff that they have published.}"[Marco, 1]. Further, Academia suggests publications to researchers based on their research interests and previous interactions on the website.

In conclusion, it can be stated that a large part of the tools mentioned by the Interviewees are used for locating and accessing publications and that much of it is used on websites as server-side software.

\section{Information Practices Towards Software}
\label{sec:IP_SW}
% introduction
In the last section I introduced software tools that the interviewees use in their research projects. This section now focuses on the information practices that the classical philologists engage when seeking for software tools for research or for information on the use of such software. I will structure this section according to the investigated modes of information practices in the accounts of the participants. A general overview of the perceived information practices is presented in the introduction section {\ref{sec:IP_Introduction}. The very dominant mode, seeking, is then discussed in section \ref{sec:IP_Seeking}. This is followed by explanations on scanning (section \ref{sec:IP_Scanning}) and monitoring (section \ref{sec:IP_Monitoring}). Both information practices were rarely reported by the Interviewees. In contrast, Interviewees were more often referred to software or solutions to software problems by proxy (section \ref{sec:IP_Proxy}) through colleagues or friends. Coincidence is another phenomenon that plays an important role in the interviewees' information practices. This will be discussed in more detail in section \ref{sec:IP_Coincidences}.

% wenig softwaresuche allgemein, wenig bedarf
\subsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:IP_Introduction}
Most interviewees were irritated when I asked them about the search for software. They had to think for a while about when they last searched for a specific tool. The reaction is not necessarily surprising, considering that classical philologists use very little software in their everyday research: "\textit{[...] we don't use so much technology, so to speak, or many software.}" [Christian, 2]. Therefore, the information practices for searching for software are more difficult for the participants to retrieve in their accounts during the interview. In contrast to literature research, seeking software or information about software usage is rarely practiced. 

% seeking
\subsection{Seeking}
\label{sec:IP_Seeking}
%% google
All Interviewees write their research papers using the text editor Word. Knowledge of how to use functions perceived as complex, such as the automatic creation of directories, the handling of special characters or the automatic formatting of heading hierarchies, is often gained by using Google's search engine and its search results:

\begin{quotation}
"\textit{My knowledge comes from Google research, so according to the motto Google is my friend. And with Word I do almost everything, exactly with formatting stuff and almost everything alone.[...] I google all the time.}" [Marie, 2]
\end{quotation}

Using Google is often the first reflex in such a search process. However, since the search for software enjoys only a subordinate priority in terms of available time resources, the search is also interrupted relatively early if the desired search success does not materialize:

%% suche wird früh abgebrochen
\begin{quotation}
"\textit{Yes, I am more likely to drop out than literature research. Then I give up and think okay, then that's the way it is, then I have to get along somehow differently. [...] This is also due to time, above all. I think there are more important things, I just put my focus on my work, like literature research or writing whatever. And then I think okay, you are wasting too much time here, so I am too impatient.}" [Christian, 2]
\end{quotation}

With the LLTA database it is relatively easy, the university has subscribed to it and it usually costs money and we can use it for free. And somebody here will have tried it and found it to be good and now everybody uses it.} " [Marco, 2]
\end{quotation}

%% weil der proxy so gut funktioniert, muss man die darüber erhaltenen Informationen nicht anderweitig ausfindig machen => vielleicht etwas für die diskussion!?
If the information has already reached an Interviewee via a proxy, he or she no longer needs to actively search for it.

\begin{quotation}
"\textit{If you somehow don't really know what to query, then you stop searching. Or you have to understand something about searching, and if you understand little about it, then you search less and are then clearly only need-oriented in terms of the concrete. I really need this and that now, then I'll see if I can find it.}" [Peter, 1]

%%% Hypo 1
- classical philologists do not reflect much on the research process - which is why they do not regarding software use either => as a matter of fact, the analysis focus is on information practices in the widest sense


%%% Hypo 2
- tool selection is very much trust based (recommendations/consulting from colleagues and friends/family)

%%% Hypo 3
- negative experiences in digital humanities projects induce skepticism towards digital tools

%%% Hypo 4
- difficulties in formulating the right search terms (what they describe as well as what I could listen to during the interviews)
